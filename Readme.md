# PHP Development Environment with Nginx and PHP 8 using VS Code and Xdebug

## Prerequisites

1. Download and unpack this project, then open the folder in VS Code. This is important as the debugging configuration in `.vscode/launch.json` relies on the correct workspace path.
2. Install the `PHP Debug` extension in VS Code to enable breakpoints and debugging features.
3. Install Docker Desktop or Podman on your system.
   - For Docker: Install Docker Desktop
   - For Podman: Install Podman and podman-compose

## Docker and Podman Configuration

The project uses the following compose configuration (`docker-compose.yml`, included in this package):

```yml
services:
  server:
    image: ghcr.io/thi-cs-slides/simple-nginx-with-php:main
    ports:
      - "8181:80"
    volumes:
      - ./src:/var/www/html:z
      - ./logs:/var/log/nginx:z
```

## VS Code Debug Configuration

Xdebug requires a port on your development machine where the PHP server can connect to. The following configuration needs to be placed in `.vscode/launch.json` (already included in this package):

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9003,
            "pathMappings": {
                "/var/www/html": "${workspaceFolder}/src"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Running the Environment

### Start the Server

1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` or `podman-compose up -d`
3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8181`

### Debug PHP Code

1. Open your PHP source file in VS Code
2. Set breakpoints by clicking in the left margin
3. Start the debugger via the Run menu or F5
4. Open your PHP file in the browser
5. Code execution will pause at your breakpoints

### Stop the Server

Run `docker-compose down` or `podman-compose down` to stop and remove the containers.

### Notes for SELinux Users

The `:z` suffix on volume mounts is required for systems with SELinux enabled (like Fedora, RHEL, CentOS). It allows the container to access the mounted directories.
